/=================\
|=== Changelog ===|
\=================/


=== 0.9.11 ===

Bugfixes:
- Fixed caching behavior. The map now updates correctly when a text editor
  is saved and closed.
- Mod files without a path = "" entry are now correctly supported again.


=== 0.9.10 ===

New features:
- New support for March of the Eagles.
- New modes for viewing which provinces and countries have history files
  and which don't. Find them under the new "Modding views" submenu.
- New mode to view all climates at once (with stripes if multiple climate types
  are active for a province).
- New dialog for making custom scaling modes for either provinces or countries.
  Currently only works with integers, so no 0.0-1.0 scaling.
- New majority pop religion, majority pop culture, and majority pop type mapmodes
  for Victoria 2.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed a bug causing pathological behavior during drawing if many land provinces
  don't have history files. Most noticeable in MotE-EVW.
- Clarified in game version selection that Victoria 2 and A House Divided
  are two different things, and the settings for one will not work with the other.


=== 0.9.9 ===

New features:
- New About dialog with project links

Bugfixes:
- The editor will now correctly create intermediate folders when saving Victoria 2
  province history files into a mod.


=== 0.9.8 ===

New features:
- New multi-edit feature! When multiple provinces are selected, clicking
  "Show province history" will now bring up a blank text editor. Anything
  written in this editor will be saved to all selected provinces. The editor
  will automatically do an intelligent merge:
    1. A simple string like "owner = FRA" will overwrite any previous owner
       but not anything inside a date block.
    2. A date block like 1500.1.1 = { } will be merged with any existing block
       of the exact same date (1500.1.1, not 1500.1.2) or simply created if
       there was no previous block of that date.
    3. Comments are carried over, but the format may change slightly.
    4. All affected files are automatically reformatted with simple strings
       at the top and date blocks in order afterwards.
- New "Player countries" view when working with a saved game. Highlights all
  countries that are being played by a human.
- New "Unrest" view for EU4, replacing the "Revolt risk" view.
- New option in the editor dialog to turn off automatic backups of history files
  when saving (see the file menu).

Bugfixes:
- When working with a mod, all edited files will now be saved into the mod folder.
  Previously, the editor would sometimes overwrite the vanilla file if there was
  no equivalent file in the mod.
- Correctly populate the mod dropdown in the opening dialog when the
  game directory is pasted into the text field rather than browsing.
- HOI3: Their Finest Hour now uses Clausewitz 2 mod behavior, unlike HOI3 vanilla.


=== 0.9.7 ===

New features:
- New "Simple Terrain" mode for EU4, CK2, and Victoria 2. Simple terrain mode
  only uses terrain.txt or province history files, not terrain.bmp.
- New set of "Geography" modes which show all of (areas, regions, super regions,
  continents) at once, if supported. EU4 supports all four, while Victoria 2
  only supports regions and continents.
- Added new buttons "Blink selected province(s)" and "Copy selected province ID(s)"
  to make it easy to use the editor to build province lists for mods.

Improvements:
- Text editor now supports case insensitive searching.
- EU4 trade node map now includes arrowheads to indicate the direction of flow.
- In EU4 saves, province histories now treat "owner" and "fake_owner" as the same thing.
- CK2's .info files are now ignored when the editor is reading all files in
  a directory inside the "common" folder.
- "A House Divided" is now called "Victoria 2: A House Divided" in games.txt
  to hopefully make it clear that most Victoria 2 users should be using it.

Bugfixes:
- Errors should now mostly be caught and logged by the application instead of
  simply crashing.
- Fixed a crash when running under OpenJDK 15.
- Fixed the province, country, and culture list dialogs inside the text editor.
- Fixed some broken parts of mod file resolution under CK2 and Victoria 2.
- Fixed sea zone parsing in CK2's default.map. Ireland is no longer underwater.
- Fixed issue with Victoria 2 mod default.map files that use
  definitions = "../<modname>/map/definition.csv"
- Fixed some issues with CK2 save file parsing.
- Text editor title bar now correctly shows the name of the current file when
  working on Victoria 2 history files.


=== 0.9.6 ===

- Fixed version checker to work with Java 10+.
- Added "hot spots" view of which provinces have changed hands the most.


=== 0.9.5 ===

- Miscellaneous updates to support changes in EU4 1.17, 1.18, and 1.19.
- Fixed crashes:
    - When loading a region that includes an area which is not defined
    - When loading an area with a color block (EU4 1.19)
    - When loading a religious group with no religions inside
    - When loading a trade node with no member provinces
    - When attempting to load a mod in an archive (.zip file)
- Save files are now remembered between launches.
- Title mode now works correctly in CK2 save games.
- Religion mode now supports defining religion colors with RGB values from 0-255
  instead of 0.0-1.0 as in previous patches. All modes now support both types.

=== 0.9.1 ===

- Updated region parsing code for the changes in EU4 1.15.
- Empty areas are now loaded correctly and will appear in the area menu.

- Fixed region mapmode for EU4 1.14.
- Fixed a potential crash on startup.
- Fixed crash when loading a game that has neither common\defines.txt nor a
  common\defines directory.
- Fixed a bug when editing a country with a tag that comes alphabetically
  before "AAA" (e.g. "A00").
- Menus which are sorted alphabetically no longer sort uncapitalized entries to
  the end.
- Wasteland provinces no longer appear red in many mapmodes.
- ’ (right single quote) and – (en dash) are now parsed as valid word characters,
  making hmong–mien a valid culture group tag.

  countries start with the same letter.


=== 0.8.10 ===

=== 0.8.8 ===

- Fixed crash on startup when config.txt is missing.
- Auto-update checks are now turned on by default.
- Added logging if an unexpected error happens.


=== 0.8.7 ===

- Zipped saves can now be loaded. Making any changes will result in a non-zipped
  save, so be warned.
- Implemented automatic version checking. On launch, the editor will attempt to
  read an XML version file hosted on SourceForge, and if a new version is
  available, the Help menu will draw attention to it. This behavior can be
  turned off by setting check_for_updates = no in config.txt. Manual version
  checking is always available via a new item in the Help menu.
- Implemented proper logging instead of printing to the console. It is no longer
  necessary to use the .bat file to capture error messages; all output is
  printed to output.log for easy access.
- Added Paradox forum thread links to Help->About.
- "controller" blocks in EU4 saves no longer cause warnings to be printed.

=== 0.8.4 ===

- Mods can now be defined in My Documents. The subdirectory is defined in
  games.txt.
- Files in the mod directory that have the exact same name and path as a vanilla
  file are now treated as overwriting that file even if not specified by a
  replace or replace_path command.

- Bookmarks now display the date next to the name.
- Out-of-memory errors now cause an error message to appear rather than silently shutting the application down.


=== 0.8 ===

- Complete revamp of all initialization and loading code.
- Game types are now defined in games.txt
- Fixed many longstanding bugs
- Improved error messages throughout the application


=== 0.7.4 ===

Changed:
- Provinces are now shown with their names from the localization files, not
  the names defined in definition.csv.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed crash when loading a localization file with a blank line.


=== 0.7.3 ===

Changed:
- Double-clicking a province now always opens the province editor, even in the
  political view.

Bugfixes:
- Forcing a reload should no longer freeze the editor for a long time.


=== 0.7.2 ===

Changed:
- The buildings and cultures menu will now split into submenus if necessary.

=== 0.7 ===

Now compatible with Heir to the Throne.
And Divine Wind.
And Victoria 2.

And Rome.
Good enough?

Added:
- A few new view sets, mostly for the new games.
- There is now a button to display a table of wars. Double-clicking a row of the
  table pops up a file dialog. Saving changes is not supported yet.

Changed:
- Almost all mapmodes that show a single something (single country, single tech
  group, single trade good) now allow clicking to change the filter to whatever
  was clicked on. E.g. when viewing a trade good, clicking a province with gold
  switches the view to gold provinces.
- Parsing errors now display the file that the error occurred in.
- Reduced memory consumption of large saves. It's still a lot, though.
- Made some optimizations to the startup process.

Bugfixes:
- "extend" and "replace" entries in mod files are now properly case-insensitive.
- Fixed a couple of NullPointerExceptions on tooltips.


=== 0.6.1 ===

Added:

Changed:
- The date selectors no longer automatically start in 1453. If defines.txt has
  a start date in it (which it should in In Nomine), that will be the default.
- The goods menu will now break into multiple menus if there are more than 25
  trade goods.
- The wars screen should not be quite so large and unwieldy now.

Bugfixes:
- The tech group menu should now work properly in In Nomine.


=== 0.6 ===

Now In Nomine-compatible!

Added:
- New view set: Native types.
- New view set: Regions (for IN only).
- New view set: Tech groups.
- New view: Capitals of existing countries. Requested by dharper.
- Most views of single filters (e.g. "religion = orthodox") will now change
  when another country (or province, as the case may be) is clicked. For
  example, while the view is set to "trade_goods = grain", clicking any land
  province will change the filter to whatever the trade goods are in that
  province.
- Button to force reloading data (after things have been changed outside the
  program, for example). Requested by 17blue17.
- New menu item in the View Single Country menu to show the country's history.
  Now you don't have to find a time when the country is actually on the map.
- Added a way to edit war history files. Yes, the interface is a little awkward,
  but at least it's possible.

Changed:
- In view modes that had stripes (countries and religions), stripes are now
  diagonal. This matches the game more closely.
- If there are more than 20 governments defined, the Government view menu will
  now sort them into three categories: Republics, Religious, and Normal (i.e.
  none-of-the-above). If any of these categories has more than 25 entries, they
  will be split into sub-menus. Thanks to dharper for the idea and jdrou for
  suggesting how to do the government type division.
- Switching to a country-based map mode while a province is selected now
  re-selects it so that the country history button is activated as necessary.
- The .bat file now includes a "pause" line, so the command window should never
  just pop up and immediately disappear when there is a problem.

Bugfixes:
- Double-clicking a province while in country mode should now open the country
  history, as Readme.txt has said for a while.
- The initial window should never be larger than the screen.


=== 0.5.1 ===

Bugfixes:
- Editing country entries in saved games no longer corrupts the save. Found by
  an embarrassingly large number of people.
- Config editor now outputs mod names in quotes.
- Config editor now automatically puts "/mod/" before the mod name when
  checking if it exists. Found with help from Fornadan.


=== 0.5 ===

Added:
- Savegames are now supported! Requested by seboden, kolmy, and others.
- Bookmarks support. If a save game is loaded, there will be two bookmarks:
  game start and current year. If the history is loaded, all bookmarks will be
  loaded from bookmarks.txt.
- Config editor (config.bat). Requested by Charlone.
- New view set: Governments.
- New view: Country religions.
- New view set: Continents.
- New view set: Climates.
- Province borders are now shown in all views except the basic province view.

Changed:
- Totally reworked the text editor:
	- Multiple editors are now supported
	- Font is now customizable. It is saved in a new configuration file,
	  editor_cfg.txt .
	- Backups are now handled automatically (no user interaction).
	- Added menu items to show a list of countries, cultures, or provinces, so you
	  won't have to go digging around to figure out what province ID you want.
	  Note: Under Java 1.5 or earlier, the lists cannot be sorted.
	- Added find support (but only forward, and without replacing).
- Reworked the custom view creator. Country-based views are now possible.
- Optimized the history parser, greatly reducing lag on most map modes.

Bugfixes:
- Bracket matching in the editor no longer uses brackets that are commented out.
- Several other assorted fixes.


=== 0.4 ===

Added:
- About a gazillion new mapmodes. They are in the "View" menu.

Changed:
- Startup time is now about 1/3 of previous. There is no longer a progress bar
  shown.
- The "Go to province" button now can search by province name, also. If the
  province is found, it will flash (so you can see where it is).
* Editor:
	- The editor now never saves without asking.
	- The editor's OK button was renamed to Close, to be clear.
	- If syntax is invalid, hovering the mouse over the red message shows a tooltip
	  with the locations of any unmatched brackets.
	- Added "Go to line" menu item.
- Improved error messages when loading files.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed the second change from 0.3.1. The files were being reloaded, but were
  not showing up on the map.
- Assorted smaller fixes.


=== 0.3.1 ===

Changed:
- Files in the localisation directory will now only be parsed if their extension
  is ".csv".
- History files will now be reloaded after they are edited.

Bugfixes:
- Backup files now have the '~' at the beginning of the filename, not the end.
  This is because the game doesn't care about the extension of the history files,
  so it was sometimes loading the backups instead. Backup files created by
  previous versions should be removed.
  Thanks to English Patriot and seboden for discovering this.

=== 0.3 ===

Added:
- Support for walking through history like in the EU3 scenario setup screen.
  Note that after changing the date, you must click "Set date" for it to take
  effect. Reloading after every click on the date spinners would cause a bit
  of lag, so I left it this way.
  To support this feature, every province history file is loaded at startup,
  which takes a few seconds. A progress bar will appear, though, so it won't
  look as if it froze up. DO NOT switch to country mode before loading
  finishes; it will cause an exception.
- Can now edit country history files when in country mode.
- New button: "Go to province". It allows entering a province ID number to
  center the map on that province and select it.
- All buttons now appear on the toolbar and in the "Tools" menu.
- When in country mode, tooltips now include the owning country.
- When in country mode, double-clicking will open up the country's history file,
  not the province's.

Changed:
- If a province is selected, zooming in or out will keep that province in the
  center of the screen, if possible.
- When using a moddir and history is extended, if a history file doesn't exist
  in the mod's history file, the vanilla file will still be opened for editing,
  but if any changes are made, the file will be saved in the mod's history
  folder.

Bugfixes:
- When using a moddir and history is extended, if a history file doesn't exist
  in either the mod's history folder or the vanilla history folder, the new
  file will now be created in the mod's history folder.


=== 0.2.2 ===
(Not actually released as 0.2.2, but should have been)

Bugfixes:
- Now REALLY works with the full version of EU3. Thanks to seboden for
  pointing out the error and suggesting the fix.


=== 0.2.1 ===

Changed:
- config.txt now uses "maindir" instead of "eu3dir". If you have edited your
  config, you will need to change it.

Bugfixes:
- Should now work on full version of EU3.
- Double-clicking on Terra Incognita will no longer bring up an editor.


=== 0.2 ===

Added:
- Syntax highlighting for editing history files (done with an old package of
  jEdit (http://www.jedit.org) that is in the public domain, meaning no
  restrictions in copyright).
- Editor now supports cut, copy, paste, undo, and redo.
- Double-clicking a province now opens an editor.
- Hovering over a province now shows a tooltip with the province's name and ID.

Changed:
- Figuring out which province was clicked on is now much faster.
- If a province history file does not exist, a new one is created.
- Only one editor can be open at a time (workaround for an issue created by
  the new syntax highlighting text area).

Bugfixes:
- A few; can't remember specifics.


=== 0.1 ===

- Initial release
