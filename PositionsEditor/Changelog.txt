/=================\
|=== Changelog ===|
\=================/

=== May 21, 2022 ===

- Updated to work with newer games that store positions as lists of coordinates.


=== Beta 6 ===

- Fixed crash when loading malformed province definitions.


=== Beta 5 ===

- Implemented a basic map error checker.
- Improved handling of lakes.
- Province name localization format can now be specified with the province_loc
  command in position_types.txt. Previously "PROV000000" was hardcoded.
- Implemented logging instead of printing everything to the console.
- Reversed port rotation in Divine Wind.
- Made a few user interface tweaks.


=== Beta 4 ===

- Added an option to use game localization files or rely on the names in
  definition.csv.
- Corrected the loading of localization files in mods.


=== Beta 3 ===

- Rewrote much of the logic; it should now work with any Clausewitz game that
  is properly defined in position_types.txt.
- Changed the layout of the editor dialog to show the positions on the left
  side rather than below.


=== Beta 2 ===

- The port text is now printed on the side that the ships would actually be in
  game, rather than the opposite side. 17blue17 helped me realize that the way
  I thought was natural was actually counterintuitive.
- A more helpful tooltip is now shown in the rotation editor dialog.


=== Beta 1 ===

- Added config.txt, allowing the .map file to be specified at startup.
- Bumped to beta, since no major issues have been reported.


=== Alpha 5 ===

- Fixed a bug preventing new position entries from being created.
- If the province in the editor window is too big, a scroll bar will now be
  shown.


=== Alpha 4 ===

- The editor no longer requires text editing. It's all in a form now.
- Some improvements to the rotation editor.


=== Alpha 3 ===

- Added rotation editor, so you won't have to remember how to do radians.


=== Alpha 2 ===

- Added text color toggle button, so if the province is dark, you can switch
  to light text.
- Fixed placement of province names when there is no text position defined.


=== Alpha ===

- Initial release.
