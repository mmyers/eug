The eugFile project houses a set of three parsers that handle Paradox game script
syntax. The parsers are generated by JFlex from the .flex files inside eug/parser.

Most interaction with this library will begin with EUGFileIO, which has a number
of static methods to handle loading and saving script files. None of the other
classes in eug.parser are meant for direct interaction, with the exception of
ParserSettings.

EUGFileIO's loading methods return an object of eug.shared.GenericObject. This is
a tree-style data structure, but not all descendants are GenericObjects. See the
JavaDocs of GenericObject, GenericList, and ObjectVariable for more details.
